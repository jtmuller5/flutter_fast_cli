You can view the Flutter Fast CLI on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_fast_cli). Give it a 👍 if you like it!

## Activate It
Since the CLI is hosted on pub.dev, you can activate it directly from your terminal:

```
dart pub global activate flutter_fast_cli
```

You can further verify that the CLI has been activated by [listing your active Dart packages](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-global#listing-active-packages):
```
dart pub global list
```

You should see an entry for `flutter_fast_cli` with the newest version listed on pub.

## Uninstall It
If you want to [uninstall the CLI](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-global#deactivating-a-package), run the following command:
```
dart pub global deactivate flutter_fast_cli
```
